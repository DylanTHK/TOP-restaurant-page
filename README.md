DEPLOYING ON GH PAGES WITH WEBPACK
1. Remove the dist directory from the projectâ€™s .gitignore file 

2. Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).
    - git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"

3. Use subtree push to send it to the gh-pages branch on GitHub.
    - git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
